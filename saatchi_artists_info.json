I paint semi-abstract sea and landscapes, and when I am in the mood, I do some portraiture work.\nThe two themes are very different in mood and style, but both are made from using a mix of traditional techniques and more unconventional painting methods. Both rely on drawing from memory to create finished work that is abstracted, and more expressional than representational.\nI endeavour to generate a sense of intimacy and isolation while leaving the subject open to interpretation.\nEarly influences are Cy Twombly, Robert Motherwell, Milton Avery, Vermeer, Turner and Rembrandt. Elements of all have been introduced into my work. With Rembrandt it was the backgrounds allowing the paintings to emerge from dark to light. Turners handling of atmosphere which lived in the paintings, and the gestural from Twombly and Motherwell.\n\nHowever before any of this starts the painting surface has to be right. I prime the canvas many times to build up layers of primer that hide the canvas weave, and thus produce a substantial texture that will take hold of the marks I make, but allow the free movement of paint when necessary.\n\nLayers are built up of thin glazes of a limited palette. The primed base colours are then allowed to influence the top layers, or are completely obliterated only to be revealed again as the layers are then sanded back or drawn through whilst still wet. At some point the painting process inevitably takes over and starts to generate the paintings subsequent direction. Original elements can then be re introduced to the work.\n\nIt's my aim to create work that is most definitely a painting; accomplished by using rich textures, multiple layers, poured paint and brush/palette knife marks. This is my way of escaping the everyday, mass produced visuals that we are constantly exposed to, and the way in which we now digest and assimilate our visual world.\n\nMy work is hanging in private collections around the world."}, {"name": "Nikola Golubovski", "link": "https://www.saatchiart.com/nikolagolub", "location": "Skopje, Macedonia", "followers_count": "1498", "artworks_count": "299", "badges": [], "Info": "experience in painting of about 1000 pictures in oil ,acrylic on canvas e-mail: gnikola2007@gmail.com", "Education": "experience in painting of about 1000 pictures in oil ,acrylic on canvas e-mail: gnikola2007@gmail.com"}, {"name": "Deja Mar", "link": "https://www.saatchiart.com/clementdeyan", "location": "Uzice, Uzice, Serbia", "followers_count": "260", "artworks_count": "228", "badges": ["Featured in the Catalog", "Artist featured in a collection"], "Info": "Dejan Markovic - Deja Mar (1989.

I can draw, paint or project, but from all I receive pleasure because that I do all, I do with all the heart.I cannot live without my creativity of any day.\n\nMy web site: https://shulmanart.com"}, {"name": "Karenina Fabrizzi", "link": "https://www.saatchiart.com/kareninafabrizzi", "location": "Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain", "followers_count": "2209", "artworks_count": "470", "badges": ["NFT Artist", "Featured in the Catalog", "Featured in Inside The Studio", "Showed at the The Other Art Fair", "Artist featured in a collection"], "Info": "Saatchi Art NFT artist\n\n#SaatchiArtNFTArtist\n\n#Fair Director's Pick Saatchi art\n\nAAF NYC Metropolitan Pavilion in Chelsea\nMarch 22 \u2013 26, 2023\n\nART on Paper 2022 New York City\n\nI have been always fascinated by nature, the behavior of animals, the way that flowers and plants grow and how we are a big part of it, the subtle injection of ambiguity that blurs the gap between the ordinary and the fantastic.\nIn my work I want to bring nature closer to the observer, to connect people with their roots and memories.

Preparation for paintings are sketches that emerge inside my head around the clock. When I get hold of my tools I work spontaneously and fast, very often on more works simultaneously.

Taking off and then adding new layers of colour and drawing, a worn-out surface is obtained which is contrasted by bright details. As in life, in which the most unusual combinations of emotions and sensations coexist simultaneously, my works also contain various mutually opposing elements so it seems that my work is a continual process of transferring impulses obtained from life into my work.

De Kooning, Kline, Ryman, Serra, and still they are a great inspiration. And also a painter such as G\u00fcnther F\u00f6rg is a source of ongoing discovery within the abstraction of my work. But also the linear works of Keith Haring and Warhol's drawings are among my favorites.\n\nI work in Alphen aan den Rijn. A small town near Leiden and Amsterdam. Work on paper and work on non-stretched canvas and basic canvas.\n\n\nMister Artsy . Amsterdam\n\nGRAFFITI AND STREET ART\n\nLOVE THE WORK OF RETNA/WARHOL/KAWS/BANKSY/DISNEY/\nHARING/PENCK, a new series...\n\nGRAFFITI / STREETART / INK ON PAPER and CANVAS\n\nMy work is varied. Expressive or soft in color and brush action. How I feel and what impressions come at a certain moment. Cartoons, abstract, tags, graffiti ways, contemporary streetart.\n\nAbstract art and popart can alternate or overlap. I work mainly on paper. Paper, acrylic paint and watercolor. Sometimes I work on canvas, but paper lends itself more to watercolor and ink."}, {"name": "Aeidy Kassimba", "link": "https://www.saatchiart.com/aeidykassimba", "location": "Chimoio, Cidade de Chimoio, Mozambique", "followers_count": "4", "artworks_count": "123", "badges": ["Artist featured in a collection"], "Info": "I was born in Mozambique, a country located in the south of the African continent, in the central province of Manica, more specifically in the capital Chimoio in 1976, I am self-taught in the art of painting; I had my first contacts with arts between the years 1987-90, creating objects and children's toys for my own use, but it was under the influence of my father who was an enthusiastic collector of African paintings and sculptures and my older brother who is a portraitist par excellence that I started to fall in love with paintings and sculptures.

In 2003 he graduated from Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University with a Master of Psychology. For many years he was working in fashion industry, leading, among others, his own jewelry brand. After completing courses in Interior Design at Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw he moved to Milan, where he started working in this field for some Italian architectural studios. In the meantime his passion for art was growing and gradually became his only occupation. Today he sells his relief paintings all over the world.\n\nLooking at subtle, minimalist spatial paintings of the artist and interior designer Paul Bik, born in Warsaw and currently living in Milan, one can easily observe in them the presence of the Italian architecture. The Italian postmodernism of the 50s and 60s is for Bik an endless source of inspiration. Deeply moved by the postmodern buildings' forms, in his works he influences the viewer with a geometric structure, multidimensionality and synthetic forms, as well as a very restricted colour range. Nonetheless, Bik's work, same as the architecture of postmodernism, is not deprived of a certain dose of a refined decor. Art performed by Bik strongly influences the viewer's emotions with its ambiguity, combining both the intellectual and the emotional. Another feature linking Bik's paintings to the pieces of Italian postmodern architecture is their eclecticism \u2013 often because the young artist compiles different types of paints (acrylic and oil) or finishes (matt and shiny). The artist successfully manages to transfer to his paintings the spatiality proper of architecture, and consequently, to give them a three-dimensional character.\n\nPaul Bik is also considered a continuator of the spacialism tradition in contemporary art. Inspiration for his paintings can be found in the spatial works of artists such as Lucio Fontana, Agostino Bonalumi or Enrico Castellani.\nAlthough the main elements of the Paul Bik's artworks are geometric forms of simple, harmonious, rhythmic patterns of straight and circular lines elaborated with craft precision, in his compositions the light and shadow seem to play a central role. Therefore, the fact that he uses a limited colour palette seems justifiable \u2013 the colour in this case primarily functions as the background for the exposed light and shadow. Although his subtle work \u2013 with its ascetic use of colours and minimalist forms \u2013 emanates with a sense of harmony, this serene and peaceful atmosphere sometimes surpasses in confrontation with one distinct, colourful accent.\n\nBik achieves the effect of three-dimensionality thanks to using his own technique \u2013 the method of accumulating the layers of glued and stained cut cardboard, wood or paper into a mass of simple, geometric forms. Relief gains its extreme durability and flexibility during the process of fixing it with resin. In the final step, Bik reaches for the traditional painting tools, such as paintbrush and paint, giving his spatial constructions a monochrome complexion, or enriching the ascetic composition with a distinct accent, such as a shiny golden colour."}, {"name": "Chisato Yamada", "link": "https://www.saatchiart.com/chisayama", "location": "Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan", "followers_count": "137", "artworks_count": "223", "badges": ["Artist featured in a collection"], "Info": "Born in Tokyo and live in Tokyo\n\nBFA Tama Art University\nMFA Tama Art University Graduate School, Japanese painting major\n\nChisato Yamada is a painter with 40 years of experience.\n\nWhat she has been pursuing for a long time is to see the invisible.

He has worked with online art galleries and exhibited his works, both group and solo shows across the UK, UAE, Japan, Italy, China and India. He has also worked on several projects in the US, UK and UAE.\n\nSumit enjoys making artworks from different mediums that please the mind and soul of the individual. Describing his style of work, the Delhi-based artist avers, \u201cMy main genre of work is nature and abstraction, which is prominent in most of the works. I love abstraction and the fact that everyone perceives it differently. It brings me pleasure to see how people relate to different shapes and colours, and interpret them differently.\u201d \n\nSumit works aren't restricted to one style or medium of work. His works range from generic mediums such as canvas and paper to experimental mediums like digital art, mixed media and wall sculptures.\n\nSumit claims to have been experimental since childhood. Be it drawing, sketching, cooking, painting or photography, he always liked to do something no one has ever thought of, by adding his signature element to the task. To achieve this, Sumit creates his own painting tools to go with the techniques he thinks of. \u201cI usually discover different techniques to paint and construct my own tools to put the ideas into action. I pick up a theme and make a series of paintings on them. When the technique gets repetitive, I wait for another inspiration to strike, and I move onto the next series,\u201d professes Sumit. He does not have any \u2018patented style\u2019 as he terms it to be mere repetition and limits an artist\u2019s creativity.

The goal of my art is to provide a critical overview of our social, cultural and political spheres in a slightly unconventional (trendy) manner. I am more interested in self-reflection on the phenomenon of alienation I am witnessing as it goes (contradictorily) hand in hand with globalisation rather than focused on any political engagement. I feel like sheer existence is draining our last bits of energy in these crazy times. We are straining ourselves with precarious work, fighting for our dear life and in the process forgetting about ourselves and our interpersonal relations. To live in unity and harmony, peace and love now seems an outdated and illusionary hippie idea that is so far from reality.

Anonymous invisibility.\n\nGreen light: green color for relaxation, turns into a tide dragging me, pushing me. Sequence of almost hypnotic movements, and we keep on not seeing it. They are there, we do exist, but we don't realize. We ignore each other. It's like John C. Reily in \"Chicago\".

She expresses her varied moods and feelings on the canvas with use of colors and also different techniques of painting. Her artwork is a way for to communicate with the world in a way her words fail to express. She believes, abstract art, gives her complete freedom to play on the canvas. The varied perception of abstract art is also something that was involved in creating her interest in this art form. Which means, what one views sees in the artwork can differ from what another viewer sees in it. According to her, every artwork of hers, has a life of its own, as it starts with a feeling and the process for creating each work is unique and different. She did her first show in 2017 and there has been no looking back since then.\nShe has done successful solo and group shows in Bombay and Calcutta so far. The galleries where she has exhibited are:\nKamalnayan Bajaj Art Gallery in Nariman Point, Bombay. Solo show. (May 2023)\nCymroza Art Gallery, BhulaBhai Desai Rd, Bombay. Group Show.

Creating sufficient space for \u201cspeculation\u201d to awaken within the viewer the fascination of the vague and blurred is one of the artist\u2019s prime objectives.\nFrank Uhlig\u2019s works have received numerous accolades and awards.\n\nFRANK UHLIG PHOTOGRAPHY | VISUAL ART"}, {"name": "Anders Hingel", "link": "https://www.saatchiart.com/AJHingel", "location": "Paris, Ile-de-France, France", "followers_count": "286", "artworks_count": "383", "badges": ["Artist featured in a collection"], "Info": "If I should describe myself as artist, I'm probably an abstract painter and sculpturist.
